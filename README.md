# March_Madness_Predictor
Function to predict the winner of march madness tournament and games.

Started out as a R challenge in the Math Department at BYU-Idaho, https://shiny.byui.edu/MarchMadness/.

Plan to continue working on it in the future making iterations and testing different ideas. Will utilize this website for data https://sportsdataverse.org.
